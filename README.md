#ABMG (Andrew's Biased Movie Generator)

#Visit application at: abmgenerator.streamlit.app

#Purpose
This project contains a movie randomizer or generator that will produce three random movies based off a user's inputs of genre(s), runtime, and decade(s) of interest. However the inventory of movies is only films that I have seen
and logged on my Letterboxd account. 

#Data Sources
This project contains two data sources - 1) TMDB data and 2) Letterboxd application data

#Py File
The program contains general data wrangling and transformation statements to prep and join the data sources. After the data sources were joined and enriched, an applicaiton is developed and hosted in streamlit
